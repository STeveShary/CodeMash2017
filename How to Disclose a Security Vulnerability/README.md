Below are all the resources and links I mentioned in my talk; this may be more
useful than the slides!

## Todo List

1. Make a keypair - instructions at [PGP and You](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/pgp-and-you)
2. Share it via [Keybase](https://keybase.io/) or a key server so people can verify it belongs to you
3. Send encrypted emails to a friend for practice. Once you have gpg2 installed:

        $ gpg2 ——import recipients-public-key.asc

        # write the body of your email in message.txt
        # e = encrypt, a = ascii, r = recipient
        $ gpg2 -ea -r Recipient message.txt

        $ pbcopy < message.txt.asc
        # paste into an email and send!

        # Copy reply encrypted with your public key
        # from your email into reply.txt.asc
        $ pbpaste > reply.txt.asc

        # d = decrypt
        $ gpg2 -d reply.txt.asc

        # enter your password and receive plain text!

4. Add contact info + public key to your open source projects for people to report vulnerabilities
5. At work, add a `/security` contact page
